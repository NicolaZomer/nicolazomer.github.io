A Binary Black Hole (BBH) can originate from the evolution of a massive binary star. If the binary is tight enough, it will evolve through several complex physical processes: the two stars can exchange mass either via Stable Mass Transfer (SMT) or via a Common Envelope (CE).

The goal of the project was to understand the differences between binary black hole mergers whose progenitors evolved via common envelope and binary black hole mergers whose progenitors evolved via stable mass transfer, by looking at a set of simulated binary black holes.A Binary Black Hole (BBH) can originate from the evolution of a massive binary star.
