In this project, we combined methods from Statistical Physics and Bayesian Data Analysis to elucidate the principles behind cellular growth and division. We studied various classes of individual-based growth-division models and inferred individual-level processes (model structures and likely ranges of associated parameters) from sigle-cell observations.

In the Bayesian framework, we formalized our process understanding the form of different rate functions, expressing the dependence of growth and division rates on variables characterizing the cellâ€™s state (such as size and protein content). We calculated the Bayesian posteriors for the parameters of these functions and performed a model comparison to determine which was more consistent with the data coming from experimental observations.
