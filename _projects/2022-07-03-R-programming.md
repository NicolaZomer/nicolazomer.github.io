This repository is mainly realized following the path of the [Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LM/SC/SC2443/000ZZ/SCP8082557/N0) course and contains my solutions of the exercises assigned by Professor Garfagnini plus a final project consisting in the implementation of a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for fake news recognition. 

In addition to this, I also present here some works related to the [Statistical Mechanics of Complex System](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LM/SC/SC2443/000ZZ/SCP8082536/N0) course, held by Professor Maritan, such as an interesting work on noise-induced schooling of fish.

All projects are carried out in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
